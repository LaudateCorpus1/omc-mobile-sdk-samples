# The Webtrends Data Collector SDK
The Webtrends SDK is a analytics library for iOS. This repository contains sample applications that implement the SDK written in both Swift and Objective-C. In both cases, the app demonstrates how a developer might collect data from a hypothetical bank app. They also include WatchKit extensions for reference on how to implement the Webtrends WatchKit SDK.

The code samples are heavily commented in both cases, so the best way to figure things out is to dive into the projects. Additionally, the samples are both configured to use CocoaPods, so you can look at each `Podfile` for reference.

If you're the type that prefers documentation to samples, that can be found [here].
